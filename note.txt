prefetches: 处理prefetch queue中entry的数量
prefetch_hit:  sim_hit[cpu][2]处理prefetch queue时，在当前cache hit
prefetch_miss: sim_miss[cpu][2],在fill时，根据MSHR中信息看是否是预取产生的。

prefetch_requested: +1 when call function prefetch_line() each time.
prefetch_issued: +1 when call prefetch_line() and PQ is not full
prefetch_droped: +1 when call prefetch_line() and PQ is full
prefetch_requested = prefetch_issued + prefetch_droped

why issued but not filled ?

prefetch_filled: +1 in function fill_cache() if the block is prefetched. 即填入cache的数量
prefetch_useful:
prefetch_useless:
prefetch_late: access MSHR when read miss, if hit and the block is prefetched, +1
